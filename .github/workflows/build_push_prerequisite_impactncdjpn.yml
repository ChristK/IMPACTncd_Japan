# Build Push prerequisite.IMPACTncdJPN Workflow
# =============================================================================
#
# PURPOSE:
# This workflow builds and pushes the prerequisite Docker image that contains
# the base R environment, system dependencies, and R packages needed for the
# IMPACTncd Japan model. This image serves as the base for the main application
# Docker image.
#
# WORKFLOW LOGIC:
# - Triggers on every push to any branch
# - Only executes the build job if specific prerequisite files are modified
# - Uses conditional logic to check for changes in prerequisite-related files
# - Coordinates with the main workflow (build_push_impactncdjpn.yml) which
#   waits for this workflow to complete when both are triggered simultaneously
#
# COORDINATION WITH MAIN WORKFLOW:
# 1. Both workflows can trigger on the same push
# 2. Main workflow waits for this prerequisite workflow to complete
# 3. Main workflow then uses the updated prerequisite image as its base
# 4. If prerequisite files aren't changed, this workflow skips execution
#    and the main workflow proceeds with the existing prerequisite image
#
# MONITORED FILES:
# The workflow only builds when these files are modified:
# - docker_setup/Dockerfile.prerequisite.IMPACTncdJPN (base Dockerfile)
# - docker_setup/apt-packages.txt (system packages)
# - docker_setup/r-packages.txt (R packages)
# - docker_setup/entrypoint.sh (container startup script)
# - .github/workflows/build_push_prerequisite_impactncdjpn.yml (this workflow)
#
# OUTPUT:
# Builds and pushes Docker image to:
# chriskypri/prerequisite.impactncdjpn:<branch_name>

# WORKFLOW TRIGGERS:
# Currently triggers on every push, but only executes if prerequisite files change.
# The commented-out section below shows the preferred approach using path filters,
# but this was disabled because it couldn't properly coordinate with the main workflow.
# With path filters, the main workflow couldn't reliably detect if this workflow
# was triggered, leading to synchronization issues.

# DISABLED PATH-BASED TRIGGERING (kept for reference):
# The ideal approach would be to use path-based triggers to only run when
# relevant files change, but this creates coordination problems with the
# main workflow that needs to know if this workflow is running.

# on:
#   push:
#     paths:
#       - docker_setup/Dockerfile.prerequisite.IMPACTncdJPN
#       - docker_setup/apt-packages.txt
#       - docker_setup/r-packages.txt
#       - docker_setup/entrypoint.sh
#       - .github/workflows/setup_dev_docker_env.yml

# CURRENT APPROACH:
# Run on every push but use conditional job execution based on file changes.
# This allows the main workflow to always see this workflow in the run history
# and properly coordinate execution timing.
on:
  push:

jobs:
  # JOB: run_if_needed
  # This job only executes if prerequisite-related files have been modified
  # in the current push. It uses GitHub's commit information to check for
  # changes in specific files that affect the prerequisite Docker image.
  run_if_needed:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    # CONDITIONAL EXECUTION:
    # Only run this job if any of the prerequisite files were modified.
    # This approach allows the workflow to always trigger (for coordination
    # with the main workflow) but only consume resources when necessary.
    #
    # NOTE: The 'modified' property may show linting warnings but is valid
    # for push events and works correctly in practice.

# WORKFLOW COMPLETION AND NEXT STEPS:
#
# Upon successful completion of this workflow:
# 1. A new prerequisite Docker image is available at:
#    chriskypri/prerequisite.impactncdjpn:<branch_name>
#
# 2. The main workflow (build_push_impactncdjpn.yml) will automatically:
#    - Detect this workflow's completion via workflow_run trigger
#    - Use the updated prerequisite image as its base
#    - Build and push the main application image
#
# 3. If this workflow fails:
#    - The main workflow will proceed with the existing prerequisite image
#    - Check the build logs for dependency or configuration issues
#
# TROUBLESHOOTING:
# - Verify Docker Hub credentials are correctly configured in repository secrets
# - Check that prerequisite files (Dockerfile, package lists) are valid
# - Ensure the docker_setup directory structure is correct
# - Monitor resource usage as R package installation can be memory-intensive

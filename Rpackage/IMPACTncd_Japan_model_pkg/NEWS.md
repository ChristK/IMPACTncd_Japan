# IMPACTncdJapan 0.0.1

## New Features

* Initial release of the IMPACTncd-Japan microsimulation model
* Core simulation framework with R6 classes for Design, Simulation, SynthPop, Disease, and Exposure
* Docker-based deployment for reproducible analysis across platforms
* Comprehensive documentation and vignettes for users and developers

## Simulation Capabilities

* Lifecourse microsimulation for Japanese adult population
* Disease modeling for CHD, stroke, diabetes, COPD, and lung cancer
* Risk factor modeling for BMI, smoking, blood pressure, cholesterol, and physical activity
* Scenario analysis framework for policy evaluation
* Parallel processing support for large-scale simulations

## Infrastructure

* C++17 backend for high-performance computation
* Docker containers for consistent execution environment

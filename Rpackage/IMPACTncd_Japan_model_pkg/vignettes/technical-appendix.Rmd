## Introduction

IMPACT NCD is an open-source microsimulation modelling framework for public health policy evaluation, planning, and decision-making focused on the prevention of non-communicable diseases (NCD). The present paper aimed to evaluate the effect of observed changes in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors on CVD mortality, prevalence, incidence, medical costs, and Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) between 2001 and 2019.

IMPACT NCD Japan (IMPACT NCD-JPN) is presented for the first time, while IMPACT NCD has been used extensively to model primary prevention policies nationally in England, Brazil, Germany, and the United States (US) and locally in Liverpool, a city in the northwest of England. At the core of the IMPACT NCD-JPN model is an epidemiological engine that includes age, sex, smoking, fruit and vegetable consumption, physical activity, body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure (SBP), haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), as risk factors.

> **Note**: The model architecture description of the IMPACT NCD-JPN in this document is based on an earlier technical appendix of IMPACT NCD England published by the University of Liverpool. Thus, some of the text is similar to that in the earlier document.

## Epidemiological Engine

### High-level Description

The epidemiological engine of IMPACT NCD-JPN is a discrete-time, dynamic, stochastic microsimulation consisting of three modules: **the Demographic, Exposure, and Disease modules**.

Within the IMPACT NCD-JPN epidemiological engine, each unit is a synthetic individual (simulant) represented by a record containing a unique identifier and a set of associated attributes. The microsimulation then projects the life course of each synthetic individual.

Each synthetic individual's attributes include:

1. **Age and sex** as demographic exposures.

2. **Behavioral risk factors**: Smoking status (current smoker/ex-smoker/never-smoker), smoking intensity, fruit and vegetable consumption, and physical activity.

3. **Biological risk factors**: BMI, SBP, LDL-c, and HbA1c.

4. **Disease risk**: The risk for two diseases is modelled explicitly: CHD and stroke. The risk for these conditions is modelled from relevant exposures to demographic, behavioural, and biological risk factor attributes.

5. **Mortality**: Mortality from CHD, stroke, or any other cause is recorded if it occurs.

All these attributes are updated in discrete annual steps according to a set of stochastic rules based on well-established epidemiological principles.

### Demographic Module

The first year of every simulation in IMPACT NCD-JPN is 2001. For each simulation, the algorithm:

1. Draws 400,000 synthetic individuals, aged 30 to 99, from the joint age-sex distribution (this is a default value that can be modified by the user).

2. Creates backward projections to 1991 (maximum time lag of ten years).

3. Creates forward projections until 2019, with mortality considerations.

IMPACT NCD-JPN follows an open cohort approach where new 30-year-old cohorts enter the model annually.

### Exposure Module

This module simulates adult life course exposures based on the National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHNS) series between 2001 and 2019. The approach follows these principles:

1. **Statistical modeling**: Fit appropriate models with exposure as dependent variable and functions of year, age, sex, and other exposures as independent variables.

2. **Trend extraction**: Include year as independent variable to extract trends and project into the future.

3. **Rank stability**: Synthetic individuals retain their quantiles throughout their life course, with minor random walk adjustments.

#### Clustering of Risk Factors

The model captures correlations between exposures using:

1. Imputation of missing variables in NHNS
2. Conversion of exposures to quantiles
3. Estimation of linear correlation matrix
4. Generation of correlated random number streams
5. Application of correlated streams as exposure quantiles

### Disease Module

The disease module translates exposures to disease incidence using a population-attributable risk fraction approach (PARF).

#### Disease Incidence

The model follows a 3-step approach:

**Step 1**: Estimate incidence proportion attributable to each modelled risk factor by age and sex, assuming specific time lags between exposure and disease.

**Step 2**: Estimate the portion of disease incidence attributable to all modelled risk factors, assuming multiplicative risks.

**Step 3**: Estimate individualized probability of developing disease for each synthetic individual.

The implementation uses the PARF formula:

```
PARF = 1 - n/Σ(RRi1 * RRi2 * ... * RRik)
```

Where:
- n = number of synthetic individuals in the population
- RRi1...ik = relative risks of risk factors for each individual i

#### Time Lags

Time lags vary stochastically between 1 and 10 years following a shifted binomial distribution, with mean lag times set according to empirical data:

| Risk Factor | CHD | Stroke |
|-------------|-----|--------|
| Physical activity | 4 | 4 |
| BMI | 4 | 3 |
| Fruit/vegetable | 4 | 4 |
| SBP | 4 | 4 |
| Smoking | 4 | 4 |
| LDL-c | 4 | 4 |
| HbA1c | 4 | 4 |

#### Initial Prevalence and Mortality

For the initial simulation year, synthetic individuals are allocated as prevalent cases using similar procedures as for incidence. The model treats mortality from any cause using disease-specific mortality rates and applies the same PARF approach to case fatality.

## Model Outputs

The model produces adult life-course trajectories for each simulant over a 19-year time horizon (2001-2019). Annual summary measures including incidence, prevalence, and mortality rates are calculated and can be compared across scenarios.

### Uncertainty Analysis

IMPACT NCD-JPN implements a 2nd order Monte Carlo approach to estimate uncertainty intervals, considering:

- **Stochastic uncertainty**: Minimized by using same random numbers across scenarios
- **Parameter uncertainty**: From sampling errors in relative risks
- **Individual heterogeneity**: Conditional on individual characteristics
- **Structural uncertainty**: Limited consideration due to strong epidemiological foundations

## Validation and Calibration

The model is validated using:

1. **Internal validation**: Plotting modelled exposures against observed NHNS data
2. **Disease validation**: Comparing modelled disease incidence to observed data
3. **Calibration**: Adjusting modelled incidence to observed data for 2001-2019

Trends in disease incidence are decomposed based on causally linked risk factors, with residual incidence assumed to follow log-linear trends.

## Data Sources

### Exposure Data
- **National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHNS)**: Risk factor levels, 2001-2019
- **Population**: Statistics Bureau, Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications

### Disease Data
- **Incidence/Prevalence**: Global Burden of Diseases (GBD) 2021 results
- **Mortality**: Vital Statistics Japan, Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare
- **Projections**: Bayesian age-period-cohort models

### Cost Data
- **Direct costs**: National Medical Care Expenditure estimates (2019)
- **Indirect costs**: Cost of illness study for CHD and stroke (2017)

## Key Assumptions and Limitations

### Model Assumptions

| Component | Key Assumptions |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Demographic** | Migration not explicitly modelled; calibrated to official projections |
| **Exposure** | Surveys representative; rank stability; constant correlations over time |
| **Disease** | Multiplicative risk effects; log-linear exposure-response; 100% risk reversibility (except smoking) |

### Limitations

1. **Data limitations**: Pre-COVID-19 data only; limited to 2019
2. **Risk factors**: Limited to modelled factors; incomplete smoking cumulative risk
3. **Selection bias**: Unavoidable in data sources
4. **Discrete-time bias**: Annual time steps may miss within-year dynamics

## Strengths

The IMPACT NCD-JPN model provides:

1. **Dynamic modeling**: Accounts for competing risks and population dynamics
2. **Individual-level analysis**: Enables exploration of multimorbidity patterns
3. **Flexibility**: Modular design allows independent development of policy layers
4. **Transparency**: Open-source license ensures accountability
5. **Validation**: Extensive internal and external validation procedures

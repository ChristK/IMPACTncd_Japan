# IMPACTncd_Japan C++ Testing Framework

A testing framework for validating C++ implementations of the `simcpp()` function in the IMPACTncd_Japan model. This framework provides both **simple** and **comprehensive** testing approaches.

## ðŸŽ¯ Two Testing Approaches

### ï¿½ **Simple Approach (Recommended for Most Users)**

For quick validation during development, use the simple 10-line approach in `auxil/cpp_testing/quick_test.R`:

```
Rscript auxil/cpp_testing/quick_test.R  
```

**Benefits:**
- âœ… **Simple**: Just 10 lines of actual code
- âœ… **Fast**: No overhead, runs immediately
- âœ… **Clear**: Obvious what it's doing
- âœ… **Flexible**: Easy to modify for different tests
- âœ… **Direct**: Gets the job done quickly

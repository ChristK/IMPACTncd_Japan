# IMPACTncd_Japan Prerequisite Dockerfile and Setup

This repository contains the Dockerfile and the scripts used to build and run the prerequisite container for the IMPACTncd Japan project. The container is based on Ubuntu and includes R version 4.4.3 with package versions frozen as of 31/03/2025, using the [RStudio Package Manager](https://packagemanager.posit.co/client/#/). Update R packages by editing `r-packages.txt` and system libraries by editing `apt-packages.txt`, then rebuild the image as needed. You can find the current version of a system library in an ubuntu system using i.e.`apt-cache policy libxml2-dev` or check the version available in the base R image using `docker run --rm rocker/r-ver:4.4.3 bash -c "apt-get update && apt-cache policy libxml2-dev"`.

This Docker container supports the branch **master** of the IMPACTncd Japan model.

## üê≥ Docker Setup for IMPACTncd Japan

This directory contains the Docker configuration and helper scripts required to build a containerized environment for the **IMPACTncd Japan** project. Two versions of the setup script are provided:

- **Bash Script**: [`create_env.sh`](./create_env.sh)  
- **PowerShell Script**: [`create_env.ps1`](./create_env.ps1)

Both scripts share the same functionality, with the following workflow:

### Workflow Summary

1. **Configuration and Build Input Check:**
   - Accept an optional path to a `sim_design.yaml` file.
   - Extract key paths (`output_dir` and `synthpop_dir`) from the YAML.
   - Compute a hash from build inputs (Dockerfile, apt-packages.txt, r-packages.txt) to determine if the Docker image must be rebuilt.

2. **Operation Modes:**  
   The scripts support two modes:
   
   - **Volume Mode (Recommended for macOS and Windows):**  
     When using the `--use-volumes` (Bash) or `-UseVolumes` (PowerShell) flag:
     - **Project Volume:**  
       The entire project directory (one level above `docker_setup`) is copied into a Docker-managed volume.
     - **Output and Synthpop Volumes:**  
       Created and pre-populated from the local folders.
     - **Running the Container:**  
       The container is launched with these volumes mounted.
     - **Post-Simulation Sync:**  
       After exiting, the script uses an `rsync-alpine` image to sync the output and synthpop volumes back to their respective local directories.
     - **Cleanup:**  
       Volumes are removed after syncing.
     
   - **Bind Mount Mode:**  
     Default mode using direct bind mounts.

### üöÄ Quick Start

#### Linux/macOS (Bash)

```bash
./create_env.sh [optional_path_to_sim_design.yaml] [--use-volumes]
```

#### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
.\create_env.ps1 [-SimDesignYaml <path	o\sim_design.yaml>] [-UseVolumes]
```

## üîç Directory Mounting Summary

| Host Path                               | Mounted to inside Container                |
|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Project Root** (one level above `docker_setup`) | `/IMPACTncd_Japan` |
| `output_dir` from `sim_design.yaml`     | `/IMPACTncd_Japan/output`                   |
| `synthpop_dir` from `sim_design.yaml`   | `/IMPACTncd_Japan/synthpop`                 |

## üê≥ Docker Image Details

- **Image Name:** `impactncd-japan-r-prerequisite:latest`
- **Base Image:** [`rocker/r-ver`](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/r-ver)
- **System Packages:** Listed in [`apt-packages.txt`](./apt-packages.txt)
- **R Packages:** Listed in [`r-packages.txt`](./r-packages.txt)

## üßº Cleanup

- **Remove the Docker Image:**

```bash
docker rmi impactncd-japan-r-prerequisite:latest
```

- **Prune Unused Containers/Images:**

```bash
docker system prune
```

## üõ† Build and Push

Use the provided build scripts to build and optionally push the Docker image:

- **Prerequisite Container:**
  - Linux/macOS: `./build_and_push_prerequisite.sh [--push]`
  - Windows: `build_and_push_prerequisite.ps1 [-Push]`

- **IMPACTncd Container:**
  - Linux/macOS: `./build_and_push_IMPACTncd.sh [--push]`
  - Windows: `build_and_push_IMPACTncd.ps1 [-Push]`

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

- **Docker Issues:** Ensure Docker Desktop (or Docker Engine) is running.
- **macOS Users:** Install `coreutils` if encountering hash computation issues.
- **Windows Users:** Prefer PowerShell and adjust execution policy if needed.

## A note regarding reproducibility

While pinning versions with <package>=<version> is the standard apt method, package repositories (even the official Ubuntu ones) don't guarantee that every historical version will be available indefinitely. Security updates might replace older versions, or repositories might be cleaned up over time.

Below are the two options for ensuring reproducibility of the system libraries but at the moment their complexity hardly justify the effort.

1. Mirroring Repositories: The most robust but complex solution is to create your own local mirror of the Ubuntu repositories at a specific point in time. You would then configure your Dockerfile to use your mirror instead of the public ones. This gives you complete control but requires significant storage and maintenance. Tools like apt-mirror or debmirror can be used for this.

2. Multi-Stage Builds with .deb Files: In a separate Dockerfile stage or a temporary container, install the desired versions.
Copy the downloaded .deb files (usually found in archives) out of that temporary stage/container.
Store these .deb files alongside your Dockerfile. In your main Dockerfile, COPY these .deb files in and use dpkg -i /path/to/*.deb || apt-get install -f -y to install them. This forces the specific versions but makes dependency management much harder, as you also need to capture all dependencies. apt-get install -f -y attempts to fix broken dependencies after dpkg -i.
